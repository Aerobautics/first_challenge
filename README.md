# first_challenge
Description: Repository of local code for the first drone challenge.
TODO:
(1) Make branch which integrates imaging and movement, but changes movement to a random linear search of the space. Avoid collision with walls by boxing them in with a padded boundary.
(2) Add visualization of OpenCV processing and add visualization of drone movement.
(3) Add scripts to folder. Put in modification of scripts to run on virtual machine.

Local development of first challenge code

(1) Will, if you are working on this, I have not yet put in the translation of wall coordinates to the grid. All you have to do is go along the edge of the box at increments of the space factor by multiplying your x and y by cos and sin of theta, respectively. I intend to return a vector of points from cellconversion to spacestate. And spacestate should translate this to grid coordinates.

(2) Ellie, I am going to try to work on tracking this weekend. Please do whatever you feel comfortable with, and we can review our efforts.
